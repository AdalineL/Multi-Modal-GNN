# Cleanup Summary for GitHub

## ✅ Files Deleted (71+ MB freed!)

### Redundant Documentation (23 KB)
- ❌ HOW_TO_RUN.md → Merged into README
- ❌ IMPROVEMENTS_LOG.txt → Duplicate of outputs/things_to_improve.txt
- ❌ QUICK_START.txt → Merged into README
- ❌ eICU_Feature_Enrichment_Analysis.md → Old analysis docs

### Log Files (89 KB)
- ❌ pipeline_full_eicu.log
- ❌ pipeline_output.log

### Old Scripts (3 KB)
- ❌ run_pipeline.sh → Replaced by run_pipeline.py

### Checkpoint Files (~71 MB!)
- ❌ outputs/checkpoint_epoch_10.pt through checkpoint_epoch_100.pt (10 files)
- ✅ Kept: outputs/best_model.pt (the final trained model)

### Python Cache
- ❌ src/__pycache__/
- ❌ .DS_Store files

## 📝 Created .gitignore

The .gitignore file will prevent these from being uploaded to GitHub:
- `venv/` (1.3 GB) - Users install their own
- `data/` folder - Users download their own eICU data
- `.claude/` - Your local Claude Code config
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `*.log` - Log files
- Checkpoint files - Only best_model.pt is needed
- System files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

## 📦 What WILL Be on GitHub

**Source Code:**
- `src/*.py` (12 files)
- `run_pipeline.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `conf/config.yaml`

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` (comprehensive, up-to-date)
- `outputs/things_to_improve.txt` (iteration log)

**Empty Directories (for pipeline to populate):**
- `data/interim/` (empty - users' preprocessed data goes here)
- `notebooks/` (empty - for user EDA)
- `outputs/` (empty or with example results)

## 🚀 Before Pushing to GitHub

1. **Optional: Keep or remove outputs/** folder
   - Option A: Keep with results (shows what users can expect)
     - Includes: evaluation_results.json, visualizations, etc.
     - Size: ~10 MB (without checkpoints)

   - Option B: Remove all outputs (cleaner repo, users generate their own)
     ```bash
     rm -rf outputs/*
     # Keep the directory structure
     mkdir -p outputs/{visualizations,graph_visualizations,advanced_visualizations}
     ```

2. **Create LICENSE file** (if not already present)
   ```bash
   # MIT License recommended
   ```

3. **Verify .gitignore is working**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show venv/, data/, .claude/
   ```

4. **Initial commit**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: EHR Graph Imputation with Degree-Aware GNN (R²=0.242)"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 📊 Repository Size

**Before cleanup**: ~1.5 GB (with venv + checkpoints)
**After cleanup**: ~25 MB (without venv, without checkpoints, with results)
**Minimal**: ~15 MB (without outputs at all)

## 🎯 Recommended: Keep Results for Demo

I recommend keeping the `outputs/` folder with results because:
- Shows users what to expect (R²=0.242 achievement)
- Visualizations demonstrate model performance
- Example evaluation_results.json is helpful
- Only adds ~10 MB to repo

Total GitHub repo size: **~25 MB** (very reasonable!)
