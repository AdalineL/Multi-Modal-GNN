KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
✓ MAJOR WIN: R² is now POSITIVE (0.0288)
  - Model now has real predictive power vs. baseline
  - Previous negative R² meant it was worse than predicting the mean

✓ Diagnosis and medication edges provide meaningful signal
  - Medium/high connectivity patients show largest improvements
  - Very common labs benefit most from graph context

✗ MAPE increased by 7%
  - Percentage errors are higher, but absolute errors (MAE) are lower
  - May indicate model is more conservative in predictions

✓ Best performance on:
  - Medium-connectivity patients (6-15 labs): R² = 0.25
  - Very common labs: R² = 0.07, MAE improved by 4.2%

✗ Slight degradation on:
  - Low-connectivity patients (1-5 labs): Less graph context to leverage


WHAT'S WORKING:
---------------
1. Heterogeneous graph structure captures meaningful relationships
2. Diagnosis and medication edges provide complementary information
3. Model benefits from richer graph context (more edges = better predictions)
4. R-GCN architecture effectively handles multiple edge types


WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
-----------------------
Priority: HIGH
1. Low-connectivity patients (1-5 labs)
   - Current MAE: 0.319 (worse than before: 0.280)
   - Problem: Not enough graph context to leverage GNN
   - Suggestion: Use patient features more directly for sparse cases
   - Potential fix: Hybrid approach (GNN + MLP fallback for sparse patients)

Priority: MEDIUM
2. MAPE is high and increased
   - Current: 163.84%
   - Problem: Large percentage errors on some predictions
   - Suggestion: Investigate which labs have high MAPE
   - Potential fix: Per-lab calibration or ensemble with baseline

3. Rare lab predictions
   - Current R²: -0.018 (still negative)
   - Problem: Insufficient training samples
   - Suggestion: Data augmentation or transfer learning from common labs
   - Potential fix: Multi-task learning across related lab types

Priority: LOW
4. Model architecture exploration
   - Current: 2-layer R-GCN with 128 hidden dims
   - Suggestion: Try deeper networks (3-4 layers) or attention mechanisms
   - Potential fix: Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) or GraphSAINT sampling

5. Edge features
   - Currently only using lab values as edge attributes
   - Suggestion: Add temporal information (time since admission)
   - Potential fix: Encode measurement timestamps as edge features


NEXT STEPS TO TRY:
------------------
[ ] 1. Implement hybrid GNN+MLP model for sparse patients
       - Use degree threshold (e.g., <10 labs → use MLP path)
       - Expected impact: +10-15% improvement on low-connectivity patients

[ ] 2. Add attention mechanisms to edge types
       - Weight diagnosis/medication edges differently per patient
       - Expected impact: +3-5% overall MAE improvement

[ ] 3. Increase model capacity
       - Try 3-layer R-GCN with 256 hidden dims
       - Add batch normalization between layers
       - Expected impact: +2-3% overall improvement

[ ] 4. Temporal features
       - Add "time since admission" to patient-lab edges
       - Expected impact: Better predictions for time-varying labs

[ ] 5. Data augmentation for rare labs
       - Sample more rare lab edges during training
       - Use weighted loss to prioritize rare lab accuracy
       - Expected impact: +5-10% improvement on rare labs

[ ] 6. Ensemble methods
       - Combine GNN predictions with statistical baselines
       - Use voting or weighted average
       - Expected impact: +2-3% overall improvement


BEST PREDICTED LABS (Top 10):
------------------------------
1. CPK:                MAE = 0.157 (n=88)
2. FiO2:               MAE = 0.245 (n=124)
3. Troponin-I:         MAE = 0.246 (n=100)
4. PTT:                MAE = 0.272 (n=112)
5. Total Bilirubin:    MAE = 0.273 (n=194)
6. AST (SGOT):         MAE = 0.305 (n=227)
7. ALT (SGPT):         MAE = 0.355 (n=213)
8. TSH:                MAE = 0.356 (n=71)
9. Lactate:            MAE = 0.365 (n=88)
10. PT-INR:            MAE = 0.436 (n=173)

→ Pattern: Cardiac markers (CPK, Troponin) and liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin)
  are predicted best. These often correlate with diagnoses in the graph!


WORST PREDICTED LABS (Top 10):
-------------------------------
1. Triglycerides:      MAE = 0.840 (n=53)
2. -monos:             MAE = 0.836 (n=203)
3. paCO2:              MAE = 0.802 (n=107)
4. Platelets x 1000:   MAE = 0.797 (n=255)
5. MPV:                MAE = 0.788 (n=178)
6. Anion Gap:          MAE = 0.781 (n=196)
7. Chloride:           MAE = 0.777 (n=265)
8. Bicarbonate:        MAE = 0.772 (n=250)
9. Urinary Specific G: MAE = 0.752 (n=112)
10. MCH:               MAE = 0.751 (n=246)

→ Pattern: Electrolytes (chloride, bicarbonate) and CBC parameters (platelets, MPV, MCH)
  are hardest to predict. These are more patient-specific and less diagnosis-correlated.

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
✗✗✗ UNEXPECTED RESULT: Enriched features DECREASED performance across all metrics
  - R² dropped from 0.0288 → 0.0071 (75% decrease!)
  - MAE increased from 0.635 → 0.650 (+2.3%)
  - Performance degraded on medium and high connectivity patients
  - Only slight improvement on low-connectivity patients

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
1. **Overfitting with More Parameters**
   - Model now has 416,385 parameters (vs ~415,000 before)
   - 79 total features (7 patient + 17 diagnosis + 55 medication)
   - May be overfitting to training set with richer inputs

2. **Feature Normalization Issues**
   - APACHE scores normalized to 0-1 scale, but might need different scaling
   - One-hot features are sparse (many zeros)
   - Learnable embeddings were likely finding better representations

3. **Information Mismatch**
   - Handcrafted features may not align with task-specific patterns
   - Diagnosis categories might be too coarse-grained
   - Medication route/frequency may not correlate with lab values

4. **Training Dynamics**
   - Same 100 epochs, might need more training with richer features
   - Learning rate (0.001) may be suboptimal for larger feature space
   - Early stopping at epoch 64 (vs epoch 88 in Iteration 2)


WHAT WENT WRONG:
----------------
❌ Assumption: "More features = better performance" was INCORRECT
❌ Handcrafted features performed worse than learnable embeddings
❌ One-hot encoding created very sparse feature vectors
❌ APACHE scores may not directly correlate with lab test imputation task


LESSONS LEARNED:
----------------
1. **Learnable embeddings are powerful** for graph-based tasks
   - They adapt to the specific prediction task
   - They find latent patterns in the data
   - They are more compact than one-hot features

2. **Feature engineering requires careful validation**
   - Clinical relevance ≠ predictive power for ML tasks
   - Need task-specific feature selection
   - More features can hurt if they add noise

3. **Domain knowledge should guide, not dictate**
   - APACHE scores are great for mortality prediction
   - But lab imputation may need different features
   - Need to test assumptions with experiments


WHAT TO TRY NEXT:
------------------
Priority: HIGH
[ ] 1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine learnable + selected handcrafted features
       - Keep APACHE scores only (most relevant to clinical state)
       - Remove one-hot encodings (too sparse)
       - Let diagnosis/medication embeddings be learned
       - Expected: Best of both worlds

[ ] 2. **Feature Dimensionality Reduction**
       - Use PCA or autoencoder on one-hot features
       - Reduce 55 medication features → 8-10 dense features
       - Reduce 17 diagnosis features → 5-8 dense features
       - Expected: Less overfitting, better generalization

[ ] 3. **Increase Model Capacity + Training**
       - Use 3-layer R-GCN (instead of 2)
       - Increase hidden dim to 256
       - Train for 200 epochs with more patience
       - Expected: Better learning of complex features

[ ] 4. **Feature-Aware Embeddings**
       - Initialize learnable embeddings with handcrafted features
       - Let model fine-tune them during training
       - Combines domain knowledge with learned patterns
       - Expected: +5-10% improvement

[ ] 5. **Revert to Learnable-Only (Best Baseline)**
       - Go back to Iteration 2 approach
       - Focus on architectural improvements instead
       - Try attention mechanisms (HGT)
       - Expected: Stable baseline to build on

Priority: MEDIUM
[ ] 6. **Task-Specific Feature Engineering**
       - Instead of general clinical features...
       - Extract features that correlate with lab values
       - E.g., "on vasopressors" → predicts lactate
       - E.g., "renal diagnosis" → predicts creatinine
       - Expected: +10-15% improvement on specific labs

[ ] 7. **Temporal Features**
       - Add "time since admission" to patient-lab edges
       - Lab values change over ICU stay
       - Expected: Better predictions for time-varying labs


CONCLUSION:
-----------
Iteration 3 showed that **naive feature enrichment can harm performance**. The enriched 
clinical features (APACHE scores, diagnosis hierarchy, medication metadata) resulted in:
  - 2.3% increase in MAE
  - 75% decrease in R²
  - Consistent degradation across all stratifications

This is a valuable negative result showing:
1. Learnable embeddings are surprisingly effective for this task
2. Clinical features need careful selection and validation
3. More parameters + features can lead to overfitting
4. Domain knowledge should guide architecture, not replace learning

**Recommendation**: Revert to Iteration 2 baseline (learnable embeddings) and explore 
architectural improvements (attention, deeper networks) or hybrid approaches (learnable + 
APACHE only) rather than extensive feature engineering.

END OF ITERATION 3
================================================================================


================================================================================
ITERATION 4: HYBRID APPROACH (APACHE + LEARNABLE EMBEDDINGS)
================================================================================

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
✓ Kept Patient APACHE Scores (7 features)
  - Age, Gender (3 features)
  - APACHE Acute Physiology Score, APACHE Score, ICU Mortality, Hospital Mortality (4 features)

✓ Reverted to Learnable Embeddings for Diagnosis & Medication
  - Removed 17 sparse one-hot diagnosis features
  - Removed 55 sparse medication features
  - Let model learn compact representations

HYPOTHESIS: Clinical severity scores (APACHE) provide valuable context WITHOUT
the noise and overfitting from sparse one-hot encodings.

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
✓ Hybrid approach BETTER than full feature enrichment (Iteration 3)
  - R² improved from 0.0071 → 0.0184 (+159%!)
  - MAE improved from 0.650 → 0.649 (marginal)
  - MAPE improved significantly: 159% → 144% (+9.4%)

✗ Still WORSE than pure learnable embeddings (Iteration 2)
  - R² decreased from 0.0288 → 0.0184 (-36%)
  - MAE increased from 0.635 → 0.649 (+2.2%)

✓ Removed sparse one-hot features helped significantly
  - Confirms that sparse features were causing overfitting
  - Learnable embeddings are more effective than handcrafted one-hot

✓ MAPE shows best performance across all iterations!
  - 144.24% vs 163.84% (Iter 2) and 159.13% (Iter 3)
  - Percentage errors are lower with APACHE scores


INTERPRETATION:
---------------
1. **APACHE scores provide SOME value** but not enough to overcome performance loss
   - They help with percentage errors (MAPE)
   - But slightly hurt absolute errors (MAE) and R²

2. **Sparse one-hot encodings were the main problem in Iteration 3**
   - Removing them improved R² by 159%
   - Confirms overfitting hypothesis

3. **Task-specific vs general clinical features**
   - APACHE scores predict mortality, not lab values
   - Lab imputation may need different features or none at all

4. **Learnable embeddings are surprisingly effective**
   - Iteration 2 (pure learnable) still performs best overall
   - Model learns better representations than clinical metadata


RANKING OF APPROACHES:
-----------------------
🥇 1st Place: Iteration 2 (Learnable Only)
   - MAE: 0.635, R²: 0.029
   - Simple, effective, no overfitting

🥈 2nd Place: Iteration 4 (Hybrid - THIS ITERATION)
   - MAE: 0.649, R²: 0.018
   - Best MAPE (144.24%)
   - Balanced approach

🥉 3rd Place: Iteration 3 (Full Features)
   - MAE: 0.650, R²: 0.007
   - Overfitting from sparse features


LESSONS LEARNED:
----------------
1. **Sparse one-hot features cause overfitting** in GNN tasks
   - One-hot encoding is bad for graph neural networks
   - Creates high-dimensional, sparse feature space
   - Model can't generalize well

2. **Dense clinical features (APACHE) have mixed results**
   - Help with some metrics (MAPE)
   - Hurt others (MAE, R²)
   - Task alignment matters

3. **Simpler is often better** for graph-based learning
   - Learnable embeddings outperform handcrafted features
   - Model finds optimal representations for the task

4. **MAPE as optimization target?**
   - APACHE scores reduced percentage errors significantly
   - Could be useful if percentage error is primary concern
   - Worth exploring MAPE as loss function instead of MAE


CONCLUSION:
-----------
The hybrid approach (APACHE + learnable embeddings) is a **middle ground** that:
✓ Avoids overfitting from sparse one-hot encodings
✓ Achieves best MAPE (percentage errors)
✗ Still underperforms pure learnable embeddings for MAE/R²

**RECOMMENDATION**: Stick with Iteration 2 (pure learnable embeddings) as the 
baseline approach. The 2.2% MAE increase with APACHE scores doesn't justify the 
added complexity, unless percentage error (MAPE) is the primary metric of interest.

For future work, explore:
- Using MAPE as the training loss (instead of MAE)
- Task-specific features (correlation with lab values)
- Architectural improvements (attention, deeper networks)

  - MAE improved from 0.650 → 0.641 (+1.4%)

✓ Better rare lab predictions
  - R² improved to -0.0053 (best hybrid result)
  - MAE = 0.508 (close to Iteration 2's 0.509)


INTERPRETATION:
---------------
1. **Deeper patient embeddings help overall performance**
   - Adding capacity to patient encoder improved R² by 30% vs Iteration 4
   - Confirms that patient representation matters for imputation
   - L2 normalization may help with generalization

2. **Still not as good as pure learnable embeddings (Iteration 2)**
   - MAE: 0.640 vs 0.635 (0.8% worse)
   - R²: 0.024 vs 0.029 (17% worse)
   - Suggests APACHE features add slight noise

3. **MAPE degradation is concerning**
   - Jumped from 144% → 171%
   - Deeper MLP may be less calibrated for percentage errors
   - Overfitting to absolute errors instead of relative errors

4. **Graph connectivity matters**
   - High-connectivity patients: Clear improvement
   - Medium-connectivity: Still degraded vs Iteration 2
   - Low-connectivity: Mixed results (better R², worse MAE)


UPDATED RANKING:
-----------------
🥇 1st: Iteration 2 (Pure Learnable)
   MAE: 0.635, R²: 0.029, MAPE: 163.8%
   → Best overall performance

🥈 2nd: Iteration 5 (Deeper Patient MLP) - THIS ITERATION
   MAE: 0.640, R²: 0.024, MAPE: 171.1%
   → Best hybrid approach, close to baseline

🥉 3rd: Iteration 4 (Hybrid APACHE)
   MAE: 0.649, R²: 0.018, MAPE: 144.2%
   → Best MAPE but worse MAE/R²

4th: Iteration 3 (Full Enrichment)
   MAE: 0.650, R²: 0.007, MAPE: 159.1%
   → Overfitting from sparse features


LESSONS LEARNED:
----------------
1. **Deeper patient embeddings help when using clinical features**
   - 3-layer MLP captures non-linear patient similarity better
   - L2 normalization helps with generalization
   - But still can't fully compensate for noisy features

2. **APACHE scores remain problematic for this task**
   - All hybrid approaches (Iter 4, 5) underperform pure learnable (Iter 2)
   - Clinical severity scores may not align with lab imputation patterns
   - Consider removing APACHE entirely

3. **High-connectivity patients benefit from richer embeddings**
   - More edges → more signal to leverage
   - Deeper patient MLP helps aggregate this information
   - Low/medium connectivity patients need different approach

4. **MAPE vs MAE trade-off**
   - Deeper MLP optimizes for absolute errors (MAE)
   - But loses calibration for percentage errors (MAPE)
   - May need multi-task loss or different architecture


WHAT TO TRY NEXT:
------------------
Priority: HIGH
[ ] 1. **Pure Learnable + Deeper MLP Architecture**
       - Remove APACHE features entirely
       - Keep 3-layer patient encoder but train on learnable embeddings only
       - Hypothesis: Deeper architecture WITHOUT noisy features
       - Expected: Best of Iteration 2 + Iteration 5

[ ] 2. **Attention Mechanisms**
       - Add attention to patient-lab, patient-diagnosis, patient-medication edges
       - Weight edges differently based on relevance
       - Expected: +5-10% improvement on MAE/R²

Priority: MEDIUM
[ ] 3. **Multi-Task Learning with MAPE**
       - Train with combined loss: α*MAE + β*MAPE
       - Balance absolute and percentage error optimization
       - Expected: Better MAPE without sacrificing MAE

[ ] 4. **Graph Connectivity-Aware Training**
       - Different loss weights for low/medium/high connectivity patients
       - Or ensemble different models for different connectivity groups
       - Expected: +10-15% improvement on low-connectivity patients

[ ] 5. **Deeper R-GCN Layers**
       - Increase from 2 → 3 R-GCN layers
       - Add residual connections
       - Expected: Better message passing across graph


CONCLUSION:
-----------
Iteration 5 (Deeper Patient MLP) showed that **architectural improvements help when
using clinical features**, resulting in:
  ✓ 1.4% better MAE than Iteration 4
  ✓ 30% better R² than Iteration 4
  ✓ Closer to Iteration 2 baseline
  ✗ Significant MAPE degradation (171% vs 144%)

This iteration confirms:
1. Patient embedding architecture matters
2. Deeper MLPs capture patient similarity better
3. BUT clinical features (APACHE) still add noise vs pure learnable embeddings

**RECOMMENDATION**: Try Iteration 6 with pure learnable embeddings + deeper
architecture (remove APACHE, keep 3-layer MLP). This should combine the best of
Iteration 2's features with Iteration 5's architecture.

================================================================================

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
✓ **Removed APACHE features entirely**
  - No handcrafted patient features
  - All nodes use learnable embeddings

       - Improve percentage error handling
       - Expected: Better MAPE without hurting MAE

[ ] 5. **Rare Lab Handling**
       - Data augmentation or transfer learning
       - Weighted sampling during training
       - Expected: +5-10% on rare labs


CONCLUSION:
-----------
Iteration 6 achieved **BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE** by combining:
  ✓ Pure learnable embeddings (no APACHE noise)
  ✓ Deeper patient transformation architecture
  ✓ 3-layer MLP + L2 normalization

Results:
  ✓ 17.4% better R² than previous best (Iteration 2)
  ✓ Virtually identical MAE (0.6354 vs 0.6351)
  ✓ Best RMSE across all iterations (1.004)
  ✓ 38% improvement on very common labs
  ✓ 25% improvement on high-connectivity patients

This validates the hypothesis that **architectural improvements combined with
clean learnable representations** outperform feature engineering approaches.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use Iteration 6 as the production model. The combination
of pure learnable embeddings with deeper architecture provides the best
balance of accuracy, generalization, and robustness.
